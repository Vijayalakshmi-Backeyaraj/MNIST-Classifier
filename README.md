# MNIST-Classifier

This classifier employs TensorFlow 1. To install it, please create a new environment in anaconda prompt and install tensorflow 1.14 via:

conda create -n py3-TF1 python=3.7
conda activate py3-TF1
pip install tensorflow==1.14
pip install ipykernel

This Convolution Neural Network, I have built for MNIST classification consists of 3 hidden layers(depth) and the size of each hidden layer(width) is 200.
I have considered all hidden layers with same size. Note that they can have different sizes too.
